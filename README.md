# aerofoil_utility
### A toolset for aerofoil curve generation and analysis.

Aerofoil Utility is an attempt to recreate the [NACA Utility MathWorks MATLAB App](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/101864-naca-utility) in Python, whilst adding additional functionality.

Whilst currently only the curve generation and manipulation functionailty has been added. Work is underway to add 2D Computational Fluid Dynamics functionality utilising [FLITE2D](https://github.com/DrBenEvans/FLITE2D_MATLAB) and wing geometry construction utilising [gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) and [OpenCASCADE](https://www.opencascade.com/).
